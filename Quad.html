<h1>Welcome, to the Quad Game!</h1>
<p>
This is a survival game.
</p>
<p>
The game works like a normal text game, there are choices and buttons for you to press. It all depends on your current situation. For now, you need to type your name so you can start the adventure.
</p>
<label for = "name-input"> What is your name?</label>
<input id = "name-input" type = "text"></input>
<button id = "start-button">Start the ADVENTURE!</button>
